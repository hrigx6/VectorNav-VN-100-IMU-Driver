# VectorNav VN-100 IMU Driver

## Overview
This repository contains a custom driver for interfacing with the VectorNav VN-100 Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU). The driver is designed to parse messages from the VN-100 and output data in a structured message format.

## Features
- Parses messages from the VectorNav VN-100 IMU.
- Outputs data in a structured message format for easy integration with other systems.
- Supports various communication interfaces (e.g., UART, SPI, I2C) depending on the specific configuration of the VN-100.

## Requirements
- VectorNav VN-100 IMU
- Communication interface (e.g., UART, SPI, I2C)
- Development environment compatible with the programming language used for the driver implementation (e.g., C/C++, Python)

## Installation
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Compile and install the driver according to the instructions provided in the repository.
3. Ensure that the necessary dependencies are installed and configured.

## Usage
1. Connect the VectorNav VN-100 IMU to your system using the appropriate communication interface.
2. Configure the driver to use the correct communication parameters (e.g., baud rate, device address).
3. Run the driver executable or script.
4. The driver will parse messages from the VN-100 and output data in a structured message format.
5. Integrate the output data into your application or system as needed.
